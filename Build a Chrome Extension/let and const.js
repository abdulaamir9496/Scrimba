//When to use let and const

const playerName = "Aamir";    //Name will be same so using const
let credits = 45;  //Credits will be changing so using let

credits = credits - 10;

// If possible, use const. If not, use let.

// Which variables below should be changed from let to const?

// The customer wants to order some stuff. Here are the details:
const basePrice = 520
const discount = 120
let shippingCost = 12
let shippingTime = "5-12 days"

// Whops! Turns out the shipping will be a bit more complex
shippingCost = 15
shippingTime = "7-14 days"

// Calculating the full price
const fullPrice = basePrice - discount + shippingCost

// Finally, notifying the customer
console.log("Total cost: " + fullPrice + ". It will arrive in " + shippingTime)
